# CSCI-331-Final-Project

For this project you'll need to install flask. To do this, run: npm install flask

This installation will include Jinja2 which is the weirdly formatted stuff in the html files

The temp.txt and temp_html.txt files are just older versions of the program I was saving just in case I wanted to revert back so don't worry about those
